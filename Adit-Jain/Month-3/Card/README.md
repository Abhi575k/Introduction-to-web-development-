# Credit Card Management System

Using quite a lot of things TBH, I've made a Credit Card System<br>
Obviously, it's far far far from perfect, but hey, it works..

No garuntee about safety though XD<br>
All details are stored in `cardDetails.json`<br>
(For obvious reasons, I haven't stored any data in it, but can..)

Use&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm start`&nbsp;&nbsp;to start the server. Port number is 8000, but, can be changed via&nbsp;&nbsp;`app.js`.

BTW, this all info was just so that I can remember what I did, if someone reads it, "HI!"
